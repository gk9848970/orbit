Saas

1.Maps Colors generating custom properties for US
Colors as custom properties even in Saas.

2. Looping in scss

@use 'sass:color';
@use "../abstracts/" as *;

:root {
  @each $name, $value in $colors {
    --#{$name}--light: #{$value};
    --#{$name}--dark: #{color.adjust($value, $lightness: -40%)};
  }
}

sass:color a sass built in color libary for color.adjust function
abstracts contain a $colors map, to which we loop

So basically we are creating custom properties in root faster and also different shade of same color

3. Selectors explained website

4. Position absolute, First parent with position other than static

5. Grid and Position absolute

6. Suppose you translate a square as 100px in x and 100px in y.
Now also the transform origin will be with respect to where originally the box was.

7. After one turn, The rotation becomes 0deg itself, 0 -> 180 -> 360 == 0

8. The animation paused state property.

9. The infinite alternative on animation, For example if done normally animation of
100% {100px in x-direction} infinitely, 
The element will go 100px in x direction, Then abruptly it will come at 0px at end of animation and repeat.

If done with animation as alternate, The element will got to 100px in x-direction.
Then come to 0 kind of like reverse animation and then again repeat.

10. Double animation on elements

11. Scale also having issues due to transform origin and thing being already translated

12. Suppose you have a structure like ul>li>div and you have many li's
ul has a custom property which div uses,

Initially all divs using same custom property getting it from ul

You can make li:hover { --custom: xyz }, Now the li which is hovered will have the property changed, and the div inside the hover li will use the new changed value which it gets from li
